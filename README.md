# Movie App Monorepo

## Introduction

Movie App Monorepo project is an initiative to demonstrate different frontend technologies using the TMDB Server to address different features and complexities, evaluate performance and compare different frontend frameworks (e.g. Remix, Svelte, Astro etc.). We will be using The Movie Database APIs ([link](https://api.themoviedb.org)) as the data source to implement different use cases.
